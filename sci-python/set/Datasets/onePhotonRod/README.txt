Data from Phan et al. Physical review letters (2014) vol. 112 (21) pp. 213601.

The variables in the .mat file give binned data for rod response:
currNoPhot, pNoPhot: current values and corresponding estimated probabilities for responses to zero photons.
currOnePhot, nOnePhot: current values and corresponding estimated probabilities for responses to exactly one photon.

The variables in the .npz file have the same names and interpretation.

currNoPhot.csv, pNoPhot.csv, currOnePhot.csv, pOnePhot.csv: same information.
