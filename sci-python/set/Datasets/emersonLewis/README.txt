Photosynthesis data from Emerson and Lewis.
File emersonLewis.mat:
phycocyanin, carotenoids, chlorophyll: Column 1 gives wavelength in nm; column 2 gives the percentage of total absorbed light absorbed by each of the three pigment components at that wavelength.
QYield: Column 1 gives wavelength in nm; column 2 gives the measured quantum yield of Chroococcus photosynthesis.
