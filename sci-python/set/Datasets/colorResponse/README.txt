Files responsecurves.mat contains data for relative spectral sensitivity of cone photoreceptor cells (macaca, similar to human), corrected for absorption in the lens and macular pigment. (Baylor Nunn and Schnapf 1987 [Fig. 5])

Variables:
lambdas(j) = list of wavelengths in nm at which response is reported
sensitivity(i,j) = relative sensitivities at wavelength lambdas(i), where j=1 for L cones; 2 for M cones; and 3 for S cones.

File responsecurves.csv: 
First column are the entries in lambdas. Next three columns are entries in sensitivity.

(Data from D. Baylor, "Colour mechanisms of the eye" in Colour: Art and science, T. Lamb and J. Bourriau, eds. (Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge UK, 1995), Chapter 4.)
