blink.mat: Experimental data on the "blinking" of a single fluorescent molecule.

Array blink2a gives the estimated probability density function of the durations of "off" states.
Array blink2b gives the estimated probability density function of the durations of "on"" states.
In each array, the first column is log_10 of the duration in units of 1 second; the second column is log_10 of the
estimated probability density function, times 1 second. The fluorophore was a tetraphenoxy-perylene diimide dye.
