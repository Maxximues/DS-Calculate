File BaylorNunnSchnapf.mat: 
The data give the probability of seeing for macaque rod cells as a function of 
the density of photons supplied to the rod outer segment.

The variable log10Nbar contains the logarithm of the density of photon arrivals
(units of photons per umunit^2, applied over 50umunit^2. The four columns 
correspond to four different cells; the five rows correspond to five different 
flash intensities.

The variable Psee contains the fraction of 65 trials that elicited a rod response.

File BaylorNunnSchnapf.csv: Same data with the flash intensities in the first
four columns as above, and Psee in the next four columns.
